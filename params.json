It also is available in spanish. <a href=\"#try\">TRY IT HERE.</a>\r\n\r\n_Why did we choose this solution?_\r\n\r\nSPARKTECH felt this was the best solution for public riders with the existing HART resources.  Each bus stop already has the Location ID and Bus # available.  So we created a database that parses the schedules to make the information easily accessible for passengers.  We swayed away from crowd-sourcing because that makes users come out of their comfort zone and tries to force them to learn a new habit.  We focused on what the demographic already does which is texting.  We also decided on using this type of technology because we understood what type of phones our demographic uses and felt a mobile application isn't necessary for the majority and the individuals with smartphones could just find the information on Google or GoHART.org.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.danielmelick.com/hart/divider.jpg\">\r\n\r\n### SPARKTECH TEAM\r\n\r\nLuqmaan Dawoodjee |  *Lead Developer*<br>\r\nDaniel Melick  |  *Lead Strategist*<br>\r\nKathleen Tran  |  *Developer*<br>\r\nFrancis Gelderloos  |  *Data Developer*<br>\r\nErik Christensen  |  *Mobile Developer*<br>\r\nJeremy Fisher  |  *Researcher*<br>\r\nMaria Ordehi  |  *Researcher*<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.danielmelick.com/hart/divider.jpg\">\r\n\r\n### STATISTICS\r\n\r\nTotal Ridership in 2011: __14,220,590__<br>\r\n77% of passengers have cellphones<br>\r\nOnly 26% use smartphones (iPhone, Android, Windows, Blackberry)<br>\r\n__51%__ use regular cellphones (no data plan or browser)<br>\r\n__25%__ of passengers are hispanic (2011 census)<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.danielmelick.com/hart/divider.jpg\">\r\n\r\n### USER EXPERIENCE\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.danielmelick.com/hart/experience.jpg\">\r\n\r\nPassenger sends a text with “(Location ID, provided at each stop) + (Bus Stop #, also provided at each stop)” (example: “5186 46”) to (813) 434-1117 (short code is available).\r\n\r\nHARTXT sends an auto-response with the next 3 times the bus will arrive at that specific bus stop.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"try\"></a>\r\n<img src=\"http://www.danielmelick.com/hart/divider.jpg\">\r\n\r\n### TRY IT YOURSELF!\r\n\r\nHere's some bus stops:<br>\r\n\r\n__Sun Ridge Apartments Stop__<br>\r\nLocation ID: 4598 <br>\r\nBus #: 6<br>\r\nText \"4598 6\" to (813) 434-1117<br>\r\n*for spanish Text \"ES 4598 6\"*<br>\r\n\r\n__Hyatt Regency Stop__<br>\r\nLocation ID: 5872 <br>\r\nBus #: 46<br>\r\nText \"5872 46\" to (813) 434-1117<br>\r\n*for spanish Text \"ES 5872 46\"*<br>\r\n\r\n__McKinley Drive & Fowler Ave Stop__<br>\r\nLocation ID: 1619<br>\r\nBus #: 5<br>\r\nText \"1619 5\" to (813) 434-1117<br>\r\n*for spanish Text \"ES 1619 5\"*<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.danielmelick.com/hart/divider.jpg\">\r\n\r\n### EXPENSES\r\n\r\nShort Code Number: $12,000 a year ($3000 a quarter)<br>\r\nCost per Text: $.01 <br>\r\n2500 Bus Signs (estimated) x $10 (estimated + labor): $25,000 <br>\r\n\r\nFirst Year Set Up Total: __$37,000 + $.01 per text__\r\n\r\nYear After Total: __$12,000 + $.01 per text__\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.danielmelick.com/hart/divider.jpg\">\r\n\r\n### CONTACT\r\n\r\nPhone: 215.531.4937<br>\r\nEmail: luqmaan@createchwebdesign.com<br>\r\nPDF Version: <a href=\"http://www.danielmelick.com/hart/hartxt.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">HARTXT PDF</a>","google":"","tagline":""}
